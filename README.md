=======

An NPM wrapper for Selenium [IEDriver](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com).

Testing notes
-----------------------
If you're testing on Windows 8 KB3025390 from Janurary 5th 2015 breaks IEDriver, just uninstall that update.

More tips on getting setup right: http://heliumhq.com/docs/internet_explorer


Building and Installing
-----------------------

```shell
npm install ie64driver
```

Or grab the source and

```shell
node ./install.js
```

What this is really doing is just grabbing a particular "blessed" (by
this module) version of IEDriver. As new versions are released
and vetted, this module will be updated accordingly.

The package has been set up to fetch and run IEDriver for Windows.

Versioning
----------

The NPM package version tracks the version of iedriver that will be installed,
with an additional build number that is used for revisions to the installer.

A Note on iedriver
-------------------

IEDriver is not a library for NodeJS.

This is an _NPM wrapper_ and can be used to conveniently make IEDriver available
It is not a Node JS wrapper.
